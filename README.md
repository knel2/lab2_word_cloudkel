## Lab2: Topic: Climate Change Word Cloud 
### Katherine Escoto Licona

### The topic that I wanted to search was climate change and the parameters that I decided to use for this was weather, environment and climate. 

- 1.)The topic that I wanted to search was climate change and the parameters that I decided to use for the first word cloud was weather, environment and climate. For the second one I decided to use global emissions and pollution to be able to see the different results that I can get about the topic of climate change.  
- 2.) Why do I want to make this comparison?
I want to make this comparison on how specific the 3 search terms get to be able to show the result of the topic of climate change.
- 3.) Compare the word clouds and discuss the similarities
 Some differences is that the 3rd term of each search is not as popularly searched on youtube for the first word cloud weather which is the first parameter compared to the second word cloud where the 3rd term is popular as pollution. The patterns that I see in the second word clouds are more connected to the search terms like looking at global countries that could refer to the relation to pollution and emission and effects of pollution or emissions. While the first one is more all over the place talking about topics that don’t have to do with weather, environment and climate and small amounts have to do with weather and handling environment but not really covering the topic of climate change.
- 4.) What might be the possible reasons for the patterns you observed
For the second word cloud I think the search terms were more leaning towards the effects of climate change or what leads to climate change which is why there was so much population of search terms because the search terms were related to each other more. Compared to the first word, clouds were kind of related to each other but the topics of search terms are more broader and not very direct to the point.
- 5.) How your research could be improved in the future
I would try to use more search terms rather than using just 3 for each to see if it changes anything due to being more specific with searching for urls.
- 6.) Anything that the map or data 
Something that surprised me about the data was the little amount of search terms that they were populating. I was expecting more. For the second csv one there was a bit more data but it wasn't a huge difference from the first one.
